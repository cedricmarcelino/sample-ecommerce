## Introduction

This is a simple e-commerce web application I made to showcase my knowledge and skills in creating web applications based on a given design. This is not a fully functional website, most of the contents are static but the featured products section of the page is dynamic and fetching its data from a REST API.

## Functionalities

1. You will be able to add and remove products from your wishlist and your cart.
2. You will be able to load more products from the initial pagination.
3. You will be able to click on a product and it will lead you to a new page containing the product's information.
4. You can increase and decrease the quantity of a product in your cart.
5. The cart will show you the total price of the items in your cart.
6. In the product's page the carousel for the images are functional as well.
7. The web application work best on devices with a 414px width dimension and above.
8. The design is responsive.
9. Break-points for design are 414px for mobile and 1440px for desktop version.
10. The cart and wishlist data are persistent. It is saved in the machine's local storage.
11. You can navigate to a certain product's page from wishlist and cart.
