## Introduction

This is a simple e-commerce web application I made to showcase my knowledge and skills in creating web applications based on a given design. This is not a fully functional website, most of the contents are static but the featured products section of the page is dynamic and fetching its data from a REST API.

## Functionalities

1. You will be able to add and remove products from your wishlist and your cart.
2. You will be able to load more products from the initial pagination.
3. You will be able to click on a product and it will lead you to a new page containing the product's information.
4. You can increase and decrease the quantity of a product in your cart.
5. The cart will show you the total price of the items in your cart.
6. In the product's page the carousel for the images are functional as well.
